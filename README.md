# Urban Site Analysis using Computer Vision and Geospatial Data

This project leverages computer vision algorithms and geospatial analysis to generate detailed site analysis maps for urban planning and development. By integrating data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Google Maps Elevation API, the project automates the extraction of key urban features, providing stakeholders with comprehensive information on land use, transportation, building footprints, and other essential urban amenities. The resulting maps offer valuable insights into urban density, green spaces, traffic patterns, and elevation changes, helping city planners make informed decisions for development projects.

Key Features
